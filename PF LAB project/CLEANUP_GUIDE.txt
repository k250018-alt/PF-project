The following files and folders should be DELETED from the project to keep it
clean and remove unnecessary clutter. Only keep essential files.

================

Old Build Artifacts:
├─ build/CMakeCache.txt - Old CMake configuration
├─ build/CMakeFiles/ - Old CMake build files
├─ build/CMakeScratch/ - CMake scratch files
├─ build/pkgRedirects/ - CMake package redirects
├─ build/Makefile - Old CMake-generated Makefile
├─ build/cmake_install.cmake - Old CMake installer
├─ build/compile.sh - This can be kept or deleted (used to compile)

Old C Build Files (if present):
├─ *.o - Object files
├─ CMakeLists.txt - Old CMake configuration (can be deleted)

Unused Scripts/Helpers:
├─ rotate.ps1 - Used for rotating images; can be kept or deleted
├─ rotate.bat - Wrapper for rotate.ps1; can be kept or deleted

Unused Image Files (OLD VERSION - REPLACED):
├─ assets/car.png - Replaced by car_rotated.png; DELETE
├─ assets/background.png - Replaced by background-1.png; DELETE
├─ assets/obstacle.png - Not used (variants used instead); DELETE

PyInstaller Artifacts (if .exe was generated from Python):
├─ build/ folder (dist/ in Python projects) - DELETE after exe created
├─ *.spec file - PyInstaller spec file; DELETE
├─ __pycache__/ - Python cache; DELETE

Leftover Files:
├─ Any .bak or backup files - DELETE
├─ Any test_*.c or debug_*.c files - DELETE
├─ old_game.c or similar versioned files - DELETE
├─ *.tmp or temporary files - DELETE

KEEP THESE ESSENTIAL FILES:
===========================

Source Code:
├─ src/main.c - Entry point
├─ src/game.c - Game logic
├─ src/player.c - Player physics
├─ src/obstacle.c - Obstacle management
├─ src/graphics.c - Graphics utilities
├─ include/game.h - Headers
├─ include/player.h
├─ include/obstacle.h
├─ include/graphics.h

Build System:
├─ build/compile.sh - Bash build script (used to compile)
├─ build/car_game.exe - Compiled executable (FINAL PRODUCT)
├─ rebuild_and_test.bat - Rebuild helper (optional, can delete)

Game Assets:
├─ assets/car_rotated.png - Player car sprite
├─ assets/obj_bags1.png - Obstacle variant
├─ assets/obj_barrel1.png - Obstacle variant
├─ assets/obj_barrel2.png - Obstacle variant
├─ assets/obj_barrels.png - Obstacle variant
├─ assets/background-1.png - Scrolling background

Documentation & Configuration:
├─ PROGRAM_EXPLANATION.txt - Game documentation
├─ highscore.txt - Persisted high score (created on first game over)

Shortcuts:
├─ Car Game.lnk - Desktop shortcut to launch game (OPTIONAL)

CLEANUP PROCESS:
================

Step 1: Close the game if running
Step 2: Delete old build artifacts:
   - Delete entire build/CMakeFiles/ folder
   - Delete build/CMakeScratch/ folder
   - Delete build/pkgRedirects/ folder
   - Delete build/CMakeCache.txt
   - Delete build/Makefile
   - Delete build/cmake_install.cmake

Step 3: Delete old image files:
   - Delete assets/car.png
   - Delete assets/background.png
   - Delete assets/obstacle.png

Step 4: (Optional) Delete helper scripts if not needed:
   - Delete rotate.ps1
   - Delete rotate.bat
   - Delete rebuild_and_test.bat

Step 5: Verify essential files remain:
   - src/ folder with 5 C files
   - include/ folder with 4 header files
   - assets/ folder with 6 PNG files
   - build/car_game.exe exists and is current

Step 6: Test that everything still works:
   - Double-click Car Game.lnk or run build/car_game.exe
   - Play a quick game to verify all features work

FINAL PROJECT STRUCTURE AFTER CLEANUP:
